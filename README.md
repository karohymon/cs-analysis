Studies of the impact of variations in the pion-air and kaon-air cross section on muon and muon neutrino flux from atmospheric air showers.

Old stufies are located in crosssection_initialstudy/ and Icecube_diffuse_underground_bundles/old_dev_scripts/  and Icecube_diffuse_underground_bundles/example_files/ 

Slope parameter investigation is located in:


Current analysis: fit sensitivity region of cross section modification for bundles bundles in IceCube


Pltos for ICRC 2025 are loated in:
* test_bsplineclass.ipynb - illustration of cross section modification with splines
* surfaceflux_deriv.ipynb: surface flux modified vs default
